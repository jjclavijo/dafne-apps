# Dafne dataset caching app

This is internal part of the dafne project,
part of my (Javier J. Clavijo) academic research.

dafne stands for "Dispalcement As Features on Neural nEtworks".

This app conects to the data-provider container, and caches the dataset into
tensorflow objects.

Hopely the rest of the research will be available soon-ish.
